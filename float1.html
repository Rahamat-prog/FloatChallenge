         <p id="threep"> <strong> Lav</strong> (我妻 善逸, Agatsuma Zen'itsu) trained in the "Thunder Breathing" (雷の呼吸, Kaminari no kokyū) style by the former Thunder Hashira, but was only able to learn the first technique, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, he has tagged along with him, partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is.</p>

        <p id="fourp"> <strong> 3 idiot </strong> (嘴平 伊之助, Hashibira Inosuke) uses a self-taught style called "Beast Breathing" (獣の呼吸, Kedamono no kokyū), along with two serrated swords in battle. When he gets new swords, he purposely makes them serrated in order to match his preference and fighting style (much to the swordsmith's anger). He is brash and prone to reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he has proven himself in battle time after time. .</p>
